            <p class="card-text">Recent years have seen significant use of semantically annotated data in the e-commerce domain, where online shops (e-shops) are increasingly adopting markup languages to describe their products in order to improve their visibility. Research from the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/">Web Data Commons project</a> show that 37% of web pages, or 30% of websites contain structured data, of which, nearly 20% are related to products. However, fully utilising such a rapidly-growing, gigantic data source still faces significant challenges. This is because the adoption of the structured data markup practice has been generally shallow and largely inconsistent. For example, less than 10% of product instances are annotated with a category; categorisation systems used by different e-shops are highly inconsistent; same products are sold on different websites, often presenting complementary and sometimes even conflicting information. </p>
            <p class="card-text">Addressing these issues requires an orchestra of semantic technologies tailored to the product domain, such as product classification, product instance linking, and product taxonomy matching. Such tasks are also crucial elements for the construction of product knowledge graphs, which are critical for large, cross-sectoral e-commerce vendors.</p>
            <p class="card-text">This challenge aims to benchmark methods and systems dealing with two fundamental tasks related to this problem: <b>product classification</b> and <b>product instance matching</b>. We develop datasets and resources to share with the research community, in order to encourange and facilitate research in these directions. Participating teams may choose to take part in either, or both tasks, and will be invited to write a paper describing their method and system and present this at the <a href="https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/">ISWC2020 conference. </a></p>
            <p class="card-text">This challenge is organised by <a href="#committee">the University of Sheffield, the University of Manheim, and Amazon</a></p>

            <p class="card-text">The challenge includes two shared tasks and participating teams are free to choose to take part in either, or both tasks. We encourage participation in both tasks as the methods are potentially transferrable.</p>
            <h4 class="card-title">Prodct matching</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Product Matching deals with identifying product offers on different websites that refer to the same real-world product (e.g., the same iPhone X model offered using different names/offer titles as well as different descriptions on various websites).</p>
            <p class="card-text">[TODO: Manheimn please complete this section] The training, validation, and test datasets will be released in JSON/CSV format. Each dataset will contain a number of instances where each instance consists of a compare of products, ..... (features etc?). The goal of this task is to determine if the instance is ... (classes?). An example of a data instance is shown as below</p>
            <p class="card-text">[ADD AN EXAMPLE]</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Dataset download</h4>

			</ul>

            <h4 class="card-title">Product classification</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Product classification deals with assigning predefined product category labels (which can be multiple levels) to product instances (e.g., iPhone X is a ‘SmartPhone’, and also ‘Electronics’). 

This task is essentially a text classification task. Text classification is relevant to a wide range of Semantic Web research, such as named entity recognition, fact checking, and attribute validation. Therefore, we expect the research to be generalisable and beneficial for many tasks.</p>
