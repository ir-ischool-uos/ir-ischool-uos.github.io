            <p class="card-text">Recent years have seen significant use of semantic annotations in the e-commerce domain, where online shops (e-shops) are increasingly adopting semantic markup languages to describe their products in order to improve their visibility. Statistics from the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2019-12/stats/stats.html">Web Data Commons project</a> show that 37% of the websites covered by a large web crawl provide semantic annotations. 849,000 of these websites annotate product data using the schema.org classes product and offer. However, fully utilising such a gigantic data source still faces significant challenges. This is because the adoption of semantic markup practice has been generally shallow and to a certain extent inconsistent. For example, less than 10% of product instances are annotated with a category; categorisation systems used by different e-shops are highly inconsistent; the same products are offered on different websites, often presenting complementary and sometimes even conflicting information.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Addressing these challenges requires an orchestra of semantic technologies tailored to the product domain, such as product classification, product offer matching, and product taxonomy matching. Such tasks are also crucial elements for the construction of product knowledge graphs, which are used by large, cross-sectoral e-commerce vendors.</p>
            <p class="card-text">This challenge aims to benchmark methods and systems dealing with two fundamental tasks in e-commerce data integration: <b> (1) product matching (task one) </b> and <b> (2) product classification (task two) </b>. We develop datasets and resources to share with the community, in order to encourage and facilitate research in these directions. Participating teams may choose to take part in either, or both tasks. Teams successfully beating the baseline of the respective task, will be invited to write a paper describing their method and system and present the method as a poster (and potentially also a short talk) at the <a href="https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/">ISWC2020 conference. </a> Winners of each task will also be awarded 500 euro. This is partly sponsored by <a href="https://www.peakindicators.com/">Peak Indicators</a></p>
            <p class="card-text">This challenge is organised by the University of Sheffield, the University of Mannheim, and Amazon.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title"><b style="color:#333333">Task One - Product Matching</b></h3>
            <p class="card-text">Product matching deals with identifying product offers deriving from different websites that refer to the same real-world product. In this task, product matching is handled as a binary classification problem: given two product offers decide if they describe the same product (matching) or not (non-matching).</p>
            <h4 class="card-title"><b style="color:#333333">Background information</b></h4>
            <p class="card-text">Product offers are published on the web together with some textual descriptions and are often accompanied by specification tables, i.e. HTML tables that contain specifications about the offer such as price or the country of origin. The syntactic, structural and semantic heterogeneity among the offers makes product matching a challenging task. </p>
            <p class="card-text">The Web Data Commons project has released in 2018 the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/v2/index.html">WDC Product Data Corpus</a>, the largest publicly available product data corpus originating from e-shops on the Web. The corpus consists of 26 million product offers originating from 70 thousand different e-shops. Exploiting the weak supervision found on the web in the form of product identifiers, such as GTINs or MPNs, product offers are grouped into 16 million clusters. The clusters can be used to derive training sets containing matching and non-matching pairs of offers. The derived sets can in turn be used to train the actual matching methods.</p>
            <h4 class="card-title"><b style="color:#333333">Data format</b></h4>
            <p class="card-text">We offer the product data corpus in JSON format. Offers having the same cluster ID attribute are considered to describe the same real-world product while different cluster IDs signify different products. The grouping of offers into clusters is subject to some degree of noise (approx. 7%) as it has been constructed using a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308560.3316609">heuristic</a> to cleanse the product identifiers, such as GTINs and MPNs, found on the Web. Every JSON object describing an offer has the following JSON properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>id: Unique identifier of an offer (random integer)</li>
              <li>cluster_id: The heuristically assigned identifier of the cluster to which an offer belongs</li>
              <li>category: One of 25 product categories the product was assigned to</li>
              <li>title: The product offer title</li>
              <li>description: The product offer description</li>
              <li>brand: The product offer brand</li>
              <li>price: The product offer price</li>
              <li>specTableContent: The specification table content found on the website of the product offer as one string</li>
              <li>keyValuePairs: The key-value pairs that were extracted from the specification tables.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="card-text">The following example shows what a product offer looks like in JSON format:</p>
            <img src="img/product-offer-example.png" width="100%" />
            <p/>
            <p class="card-text">We also offer an example of a training set that we derived from the corpus. The training set contains pairs of matching and non-matching offers from the category computer products. You can use this example set for training your matchers. The example training set contains 68K offer pairs from 772 distinct products (clusters of offers). These products will only partly overlap with the products in the test set that we will release in June.  We thus suggest that participating teams construct their own training sets from the corpus having higher coverage of distinct products. Every JSON object in the training set describes a pair of offers (left offer - right offer) using the offer attributes listed above together with their corresponding matching label.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The following example shows what a product offer pair looks like in JSON format:</p>
            <img src="img/product-offer-pair-example.png" width="100%" />
            <p/>
            <p class="card-text">The validation and test sets will be released in CSV format. Each dataset will contain pairs of offer ids and the label ‘True’ for matching pairs and ‘False’ for non-matching pairs. Both sets are constructed from offer pairs from the category Computers and Accessories. All pairs of offers in the validation and test sets are manually labeled. Using the example training set to train <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3183713.3196926">deepmatcher</a>, a state-of-the-art matching method, achieves 90.8% F1 on the validation set. However, the test set of this challenge will be more difficult as (amongst other challenges) it will contain offers from clusters (products) that are not contained either in the training set or in the validation set.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Additional information about the assembly of the example training set, the validation set, as well as the results of baseline experiments using both artefacts are found <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/v2/index.html">here.</a></p>

            <h3 class="card-title"><b style="color:#333333">Task Two - Product Classification</b></h3>
            <p class="card-text">Product classification deals with assigning predefined product category labels to product instances (e.g., iPhone X is a ‘SmartPhone’, and also ‘Electronics’). In this task, we will be using the top 3 classification levels of the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gpc">GS1 Global Product Classification scheme</a> to classify product instances. </p>
            <h4 class="card-title"><b style="color:#333333">Background information</b></h4>
            <p class="card-text">Same products are often sold on different websites, which generally organise their products into certain categorisation systems. However, such product categorisations differ significantly for different websites, even if they sell similar product ranges. This makes it difficult for product information integration services to collect and organise product offers on the Web.</p>
            <p>An increasing number of studies have been carried out for automated product classification based on the product offer information made available on the Web. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://sigir-ecom.github.io/data-task.html">Rakuten Data Challenge</a> were also created to develop benchmarks for such tasks. However, the majority of such datasets have been created based on a single source of website, and using a flat classification structure.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The Web Data Commons project released in 2014 the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2014-12/products/gs.html">first product classification dataset</a> collected from multiple websites, annotated with three levels of classification labels. This dataset has been extended and is now used for the product classification task in this challenge.</p>
            
            <h4 class="card-title"><b style="color:#333333">Data format</b></h4>
            <p class="card-text">Data are provided in JSON, with each line describing one product instance using the following schema. Each product will have three classification labels, corresponding to the three GS1 GPC classification levels.</p>
            <ul>
  				<li>ID: an arbitrary ID of the product</li>
  				<li>Name: the name of the product (an empty string if unavailable)</li>
  				<li>Description: the description of the product (truncated to a maximum of 5,000 characters. Can be an empty string if unavailable)</li>
  				<li>CategoryText: website-specific product category, or breadcrum (an empty string if unavailable)</li>
  				<li>URL: the original webpage URL of the product</li>
  				<li>lvl1: the level 1 GS1 GPC classification (i.e., classification target)</li>

			<p class="card-text">Our <a href="https://github.com/ir-ischool-uos/mwpd/tree/master/prodcls">GitHub website</a> is currently being updated and will be ready by 16 March 2016. It will provide code for:</p>
			<ul>
  				<li>Parsing the input datasets</li>
  				<li>Scoring the output prepared in the required format (see <a href="#Submission">the Submission section</a> for details)</li>
  				<li>Baseline, which is a FastText implementation same as that in the Rakuten Data Challenge</li>
			</ul>

            <p class="card-text">Participants are free to decide if they would like to use any of these resources to support their development</p>
            <p class="card-text">To support the development of systems we have created language resources that may be useful for both tasks. We processed the <a href="http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/structureddata/2017-12/quads/classspecific/schema_Product.gz">2017 November WDC crawl of all entities</a> that are an instance of http://schema.org/Product or http://schema.org/Offer, and indexed the products (English only) using <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> 7.3.0. We then exported the descriptions (if available) of these products and used the data (some heuristic-based filtering is applied, resulting in over 150 million products) to train word embeddings using the Gensim implementation of <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html">Word2Vec</a>. We share the following resources that can be used by participants:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lbhhhV29QqBm6b-awTJVKEjlytVcg7XQ'>The text corpus</a> containing the above product descriptions (11GB)</li>
  				<li>The word embeddings trained using the above corpus (lowercased). Both continuous bag-of-words and skipgram models are available, and are trained using Gensim 3.4.0. Available in the following two formats:</li>
  				<ul>
  					<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g9zNEMP0GdAdDIF-zFK5RdW8cLasrUPx">Gensim format</a>. This is optimised for speedy loading of the model and is also more memory-efficient. Use the code <pre><code>gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load([embedding_file_ending_with_bin]], mmap='r')</code></pre> to load the model.</li>
  					<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dgWaD1_TWc3VBQxRZWCNynhfiRFCOSYU">Word2Vec non-binary (text) format</a>. This is needed if you want to run the FastText baseline. However, this model file is not optimised for memory usage or speed.</li>
  				</ul>   				
			</ul>
			<p>The effect of the word embeddings is demonstrated in the table in the Section <a href='#evaluation'>Evaluation metrics</a></p>
